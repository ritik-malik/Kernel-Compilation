# Refurbishing Kernel
So, here's the snapshots if you want a custom kernel configuration.
Just follow the steps. Also, appending your name to kernel's name is optional, its just to distinguish it from old kernel.
Otherwise, linux automatically adds .old to old kernel.
Also, if u want to configure it deep (any particular drivers, etc.), try `sudo make config` instead of `sudo make oldconfig`.
Not gonna lie its gonna take hell lot of time to configure every details. 
Just see the beauty of LINUX, fuck WINDOWS...!!!@#@%%#^&*. They don't care about users, all they want is their privacy & everyone should follow their hardcore rules. If u r a windows lover, I won't abuse u, just accuse your innocence.
Enough talk, gonna keeping the Readme short, coz most of them are gonna clone without reading it.
But if you are still reading I appreciate your patience. Any doubts? Let's have a chat-
